h1. <a href="../classes/LocusTree.html">LocusTree</a> - Ruby library to
search genomic loci using R-Tree
</p>
<p>
_&quot;Features should not know where they are&quot; (James Bonfield, WTSI
- paraphrased)_
</p>
<p>
h2. Problem setting
</p>
<p>
Imagine an application that handles features on a chromosome (e.g. genes)
and lets you select a region for which to return all of those features. As
the mapping information is normally stored in the feature (having a
<em>start</em> and an <em>end</em> on a chromosome), you have to go through
all features sequentially to determine which ones are actually in your
region and should be displayed.
</p>
<p>
Or imagine a visualization like Google Maps but displaying quantitative
information rather than streets and roads. Let&#8216;s say the height of
the terrain. Also suppose that you have data for every square meter in the
UK. When you look at the whole of the UK at once in a 800x600 pixel display
you won&#8216;t be able to show all raw data but will have to average the
data for large regions of the UK.
</p>
<p>
h2. A solution
</p>
<p>
What you can do to solve the above two problems, is build a hierarchical
tree, where the top node contains the average for the complete dataset
(i.c. terrain height), and a small group of non-intersecting leaf nodes.
These leaf nodes together should make up the whole top node. Each leaf node
again contains the average of all data within it, and is subdivided into
ever smaller leaf nodes, and so on.
</p>
<p>
When looking at a map of the whole of the UK, we know that we need height
information for 800x600=480,000 pixels. Instead of loading the whole height
dataset at this point, we just take that layer of the R-tree that contains
480,000 leafs or is the closest to it.
</p>
<p>
h3. Example data structure
</p>
<p>
Suppose you have 20 ranges: 10..15, 20..25, 30..35, 40..45, &#8230; A <a
href="../classes/LocusTree.html">LocusTree</a> with minimum number of
children of 2 and maximum number of children of 3 would look like this (a
&#8216;value&#8217; for each of the ranges (e.g. read depth) is added
between parentheses): &lt;pre&gt;
</p>
<pre>
  LEVEL 0           LEVEL 1             LEVEL 2            LEVEL 3 (=root)
  10..15 (1)    -+
  20..25 (2)     |- 10..35 (2)      -+
  30..35 (3)    -+                   |
  40..45 (4)    -+                   |
  50..55 (5)     |- 40..65 (5)       |- 10..95 (5)      -+
  60..65 (6)    -+                   |                   |
  70..75 (7)    -+                   |                   |
  80..85 (8)     |- 70..95 (8)      -+                   |
  90..95 (9)    -+                                       |
  100..105 (10) -+                                       |
  110..115 (11)  |- 100..125 (11)   -+                   |
  120..125 (12) -+                   |                   |- 10..205 (10.5)
  130..135 (13) -+                   |                   |
  140..145 (14)  |- 130..155 (14)    |- 100..185 (14)    |
  150..155 (15) -+                   |                   |
  160..165 (16) -+                   |                   |
  170..175 (17)  |- 160..185 (17)   -+                   |
  180..185 (18) -+                                       |
  190..195 (19) -+                                       |
  200..205 (20) -+- 190..205 (19.5) --- 190..205 (19.5) -+
</pre>
<p>
&lt;/pre&gt;
</p>
<p>
If you would have to display this whole region, but only have 7 pixels to
do it in, you would use the data in LEVEL 1. It is no use trying to cram in
all raw data from LEVEL 0 because it can&#8216;t all be shown. For each
parent node, the value for that node is the average of the child nodes
weighted by the number of LEVEL 0 nodes that are covered by each child.
</p>
<p>
h3. Terms
</p>
<p>
Because of the nature of the beast, several objects have to play together
to provide this functionality:
</p>
<ul>
<li>*<a href="../classes/LocusTree/Node.html">LocusTree::Node</a>*: This is the
bin that contains data. There are 3 types of nodes: (1) <em>leaf</em>,
which is a bin at the highest resolution (currently, every single input
locus gets its own leaf node), (2) <em>index</em>, which is any bin
containing other bins, and (3) <em>root</em>, which is the top bin. There
is only one <em>root</em> node per tree.

</li>
<li>*<a href="../classes/LocusTree/Level.html">LocusTree::Level</a>*: All leaf
nodes are level 0, and are binned into a bin level 1, which in turn&#8230;

</li>
<li>*<a href="../classes/LocusTree/Tree.html">LocusTree::Tree</a>*: Every
independent scaffold (i.e. chromosome, contig, linkage_group, &#8230;) has
its own tree, because it does not make sense to search for loci that span
different chromosomes&#8230;

</li>
<li>*<a href="../classes/LocusTree/Container.html">LocusTree::Container</a>*:
The main container with all data. There&#8216;s only one container.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
h3. Usage
</p>
<p>
Input data has to be in GFF format.
</p>
<p>
&lt;pre&gt; require &#8216;locus_tree&#8217; locus_container =
LocusTree::Container.new(2,3, &#8216;index_file.sqlite3&#8217;)
locus_container.bulk_load(&#8216;data_with_values.gff&#8217;) results =
locus_container.search(<a
href="../classes/Locus.html#M000011">Locus.new</a>(&#8216;1&#8217;,41,89),
1) # Search for that range returning nodes on LEVEL 1. puts
results.collect{|n| n.value}.sort # output: [5,8] &lt;/pre&gt;
</p>
<p>
The above creates a database file (here named
&#8216;index_file.sqlite3&#8217;) which can be used afterwards. So we
don&#8216;t need to recreate the index. &lt;pre&gt; require
&#8216;locus_tree&#8217; locus_container =
LocusTree::Container.open(&#8216;index_file.sqlite3&#8217;) results =
locus_container.search(<a
href="../classes/Locus.html#M000011">Locus.new</a>(&#8216;1&#8217;,41,89),
1) puts results.collect{|n| n.value}.sort &lt;/pre&gt;
</p>
<p>
Creating this index for 6.04 million loci with a node size of 250 elements
on my laptop took 43 minutes. However, when that index database was
created, it can be accessed and queried in fractions of seconds.
</p>
<p>
h2. Sample
</p>
<p>
There&#8216;s a sample directory with three scripts: one to build a
collection of raw data, one to build the index and one to do a search. The
example data is 1 million readdepth datapoints.
</p>
<p>
A very crude benchmark on different binsizes
</p>
<ul>
<li>*binsize = 50*

</li>
</ul>
<p>
** database size = 44Mb ** building index takes 6 minutes 4 seconds **
searching index (chr1 from pos 500 to 7000) takes less than 1 second
</p>
<ul>
<li>*binsize = 2*

</li>
</ul>
<p>
** database size = 87Mb ** building index takes 16 minutes 10 seconds **
searching index takes 4 seconds
</p>
<p>
h2. To do
</p>
<ul>
<li>Add methods to insert datapoints

</li>
<li>Add methods to split and merge nodes (based on Container.min_children)

</li>
<li>Add additional ways to aggregate data other than the average value

</li>
<li>Check if things still work with loci that are of different sizes and that
overlap

</li>
<li>Allow different approaches for creating the bins (e.g. based on number of
elements, based on maximum range, &#8230;)

</li>
<li>Remove hard-coded temporary filename for sqlite3 import.

</li>
<li>Decrease size of database

</li>
<li>Speed up data loading (especially Array#each_slice)

</li>
<li>Add inline documentation

</li>
</ul>
